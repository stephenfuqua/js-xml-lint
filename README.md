# js-xml-lint

Command line XML Linter, in JavaScript (via TypeScript).

## Use Case

As a developer, I want to validate XML files for internal consistency and
adherence to a defined schema, so that I can be confident that my XML files are
logically correct and should work "as advertised" (by the schema) in downstream
systems.

Conditions of satisfaction:

1. Command line tool that can run on Windows, Linux, or Mac.
2. Readable / actionable console output.
3. SARIF file reporting for use with continuous integration (CI) environments.
4. GitHub Action job.
